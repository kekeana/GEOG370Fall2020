        <h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessed Earthquakes and Fault Lines Map </h1>
        <h2>Keana Oldham</h2>
        <p>The following map displays where earthquakes have been recorded in 2019 and where the active fault zones are as of 2014. There is a correlation between where the fault lines occur and where the earthquakes occur. <br/>
            Research Question: What earthquakes lie within fault zones (area within 500 meters of line)? What counties have the most severe earthquakes and the most fault lines? 
        </p> 
        <br/>
        <p>Process:<br/>
            I first dissolved the counties of California, and then made a buffer around this dissolved layer. This California buffer is buffered by 100 km, 
            which is the range large earthquakes can be felt. I then clipped both my fault lines and earthquakes vector layers to reduce the data outside of California. 
            I then buffered both of these clipped files in order to define the fault zone within 500 meters of the fault lines and a circle of radius 1 kilometer from 
            the earthquake epicenter. I created a symmetrical difference of the buffered fault zones and buffered earthquakes. Finally, I created an intersection of 
            the buffered fault zones and buffered earthquakes in order to show where there are earthquakes over fault zones.
