        <h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessed Earthquakes and Fault Lines Map </h1>
        <h2>Keana Oldham</h2>
        <p>The following map displays where earthquakes have been recorded in 2019 (the 2020 dataset was empty, COVID-19 related perhaps?). The symbols are larger and darker for the earthquakes larger in magnitude. I also included a reference scale 
            to see the destructive power of the magnitude of earthquakes. The map also has vector lines representing the active fault lines around California. There is a correlation between where the fault lines occur and where the earthquakes occur.

        <p>I chose this topic because I wanted to examen climate data about the West Coast, with emphasis on California. California hasnâ€™t had a major quake (7.0+) in a while, and so tension has been building up along the faults, 
            which will lead to a severe quake. I wanted to make a map to show where the quakes take place, and using the faults, where there may be future quakes. Compared to my homework 7, I also want to see what populations may be effected.
