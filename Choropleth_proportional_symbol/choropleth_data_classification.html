        <h1>Homework 8: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
        <h2>Keana Oldham</h2>
        <h3>The following maps represent different categorizations of the same dataset: the ratio of population reported to be below poverty level to the total population, in 2018. <br/> 
            I chose this ratio because the number of individuals in poverty doesn't mean a lot unless it is compared to another datum. The datum I used was the total population within each respective county. This is to show how prevalent in each county poverty is.</h3>

        </a>
        <h3>Equal Count Pros and Cons</h3>
        <p>Pros: Divides data up equally, Extreme data doesn't largely warp the intervals.<br/>Cons: Data only appears to be equally spread out, Unequal intervals are not as intuitive to understand.</p>

        </a>
        <h3>Natural Breaks Pros and Cons</h3>
        <p>Pros: Recognizes clusters in the data, Accounts for how the data is distributed.<br/> Cons: Unequal intervals are not as intuitive to understand.</p>

        </a>
        <h3>Pretty Breaks Pros and Cons</h3>
        <p>Pros: Divides data into visually appealing intervals, Useful if data has equal intervals<br/> Cons: Ends of intervals are squashed (not the same as the rest of the intervals), The coloration on the map can be misleading because it doesn't consider how data are distributed along the number line.</p>
