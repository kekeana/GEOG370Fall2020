        <h1>Homework 9: Proportional Symbol Earthquakes and Fault Lines Map </h1>
        <h2>Keana Oldham</h2>
        <p>The following map displays where earthquakes have been recorded in 2019 (the 2020 dataset was empty, COVID-19 related perhaps?). The symbols are larger and darker for the earthquakes larger in magnitude. I also included a reference scale to see the destructive power of the magnitude of earthquakes. The map also has vector lines representing the active fault lines around California. There is a correlation between where the fault lines occur and where the earthquakes occur.</p>
