    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:rgb(64, 200, 224)">Projection Process using QGIS</h2>
    <p>After uploading the ‘ne_10m_admin_0_countries’ vector to QGIS, I modified the symbology of the layer. Then I added the Indicatrix mapper, 
        with layers of graticule and caps, placing those layers above the map. Clicking the Project Coordinate Reference System (CRS) from the bottom right corner, I toggled between the different CRS available.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Because this is a cylindrical projection, the North and South Poles are largely warped. Since the axis runs North-South, 
        this is a normal cylindrical projection. The indicatrix caps show how the area is distorted at the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is a modified azimuthal projection. It looks more globe like, where the poles are still stretched. This projection 
        attempts to rectify area and shape distortion, but is still not perfect. The outskirts of the map are less accurate than the center. </h3>

    <h2>WGS84 Pseudo Mercato Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is a cylindrical projection. It preserves shape very well, but distorts area greatly. I recognize this 
        map the most as the rectangular shape is familiar, and the size of Greenland rivals Africa. </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is unique in that it minorly distorts every dimension in an attempt to mitigate extreme distortion of any one property. 
        This map is the most aesthetically pleasing. </h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This cylindrical projection looks extremely squashed. However, as it preserves area, the shape of the countries is what distorts.</h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This conic projection does well to preserve distance. However, around the edges of the map the countries stretch greatly, 
        as seen from the indicatrix caps. As this is a conic projection, the circular map isn’t complete.</h3>

    </a>
  
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This planer projection preserves distance. However, it warps Antarctica to surround the entire world. The countries on the 
        edges of the circle look much larger than the countries in the center. It is very interesting to see how the countries all seem to connect.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Van der Grinten Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is a polyconic projection. This reduces warping at the larger end of the cone, since there is a vertex of another cone there. 
        Distortion is minimized along the equator. Shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles are all distorted slightly. This circular map is my personal favorite.</h3>

    <h2>World Bonne Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is a pseudo conical equal-area map projection. It has a characteristic heart shape. Other dimensions hold 
        true to scale along the central meridian and standard parallel, but distort the further away. </h3>

    <h2>South Pole Orthographic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This planer projection is interesting in which one can see where Antarctica lies relative to other countries. Most maps 
        tend to greatly distort Antarctica, so being able to see its true scale gives perspective. Direction holds true from the 
        point of projection, so it is useful for navigating the poles. However, near the edge, it distorts shape and area. </h3>
